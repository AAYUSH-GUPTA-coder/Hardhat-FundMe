# Hardhat-FundMe

Created the crowdfunding dapp with gas optimization and test coverage. Used Chainlink Data Feed to set the limit of minimum contribution.

Deployed Mocks contract to test our smart contract on localhost. 

Use `Hardhat Deploy` package to deploy our smart contracts andÂ `hardhat-gas-reporter` to check the total gas consumed by the contract.
